# Gridview-in-ASP.NET-MVC

Introduction-

I have been asked so many times how to show gridview since there is no such controller in MVC like in ASP.NET. Therefore, I decided to write about all the common and simple ways of doing it. This article is written for one who has ASP.NET background or new in MVC.

Background-

In web application, displaying data in a gridview is a common requirement. Hence, we will walkthrough possible ways of designing grid view in ASP.NET MVC.

In MVC, following are the most common ways of designing grid.

<ol>
	<li><b>Simple grid design using foreach loop and html table</b>: Iterating table's <code>tr</code> tag. This is pretty simple and a basic way of displaying records.</li>
	<li><b>Webgrid</b>: Provided by <code>System.Web.Helpers</code> class which render data in tabular format with supported feature like sorting, pagination and filtration.</li>
	<li><b>JqGrid</b>: It's a jquery plugin. It supports many advanced feature which gridview should have.</li>
	<li><b>Kendo UI</b>: This is from <a href="http://demos.telerik.com/kendo-ui/grid/index">Telerik</a> which is not free. We are not discussing about it in this article.</li>
</ol>
